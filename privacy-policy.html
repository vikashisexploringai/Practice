# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** August 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how our Custom GPT (“the GPT”) interacts with data when you use it.

## Information Collection
The GPT does **not** collect, store, or process any personal information about you.  
When you use this GPT, your queries are sent to:
- **GitHub Raw Content URLs** under the repository [vikashisexploringai/Practice](https://github.com/vikashisexploringai/Practice).

## Information Usage
The GPT only:
- Reads public JSON files from the above GitHub repository.
- Returns that data in response to your request.

No personal identifiers, messages, or other private data are stored or shared outside of the conversation.

## Third-Party Services
The GPT fetches data from [GitHub Raw Content](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) over HTTPS.  
GitHub may log requests to its servers as part of standard operations, but no special tracking is implemented.

## Changes to This Policy
If this Privacy Policy changes, the updated version will be posted in the repository and reflected in the GPT’s description.

## Contact
For questions about this policy, please contact the repository owner via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vikashisexploringai/Practice/issues).
